      <h2>My Letter to You ❤️</h2>
<p>
My dearest Kriti,<br><br>

From the very first time we crossed paths, something about you just... stayed. The way you smile, the way you speak, the little ways you show you care — they’ve become some of my favorite things in the world.<br><br>

You’ve been my quiet comfort in chaos, my loudest laugh in silence, and the unexpected pause I never knew I needed. Even when I was awkward or unsure, you gave me space to just be me — and for that, I’m endlessly grateful.<br><br>

I know I’ve never asked you the right way — the way you truly deserve — but today, I wanted to change that. Not just with words, but with heart.<br><br>

Kriti Kaushik, will you be mine? Not just for today, but for all the ordinary days we’ll turn extraordinary together.<br><br>

With all my love,<br>
Your forever fanboy 💙
