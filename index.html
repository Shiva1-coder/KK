      <h2>My Letter to You ❤️</h2>
      <p>
        My dearest Kriti,<br><br>
        From the very first time we crossed paths, something about you just... stayed.<br><br>
        The way you smile, the way you speak, the little ways you show you care — they’ve become some of my favorite things in the world.<br><br>
        You’ve been my quiet comfort in chaos, my loudest laugh in silence, and the unexpected pause I never knew I needed.<br><br>
        Even when I was awkward or unsure, you gave me space to just be me — and for that, I’m endlessly grateful.<br><br>
        I know I’ve never asked you the right way — the way you truly deserve — but today, I wanted to change that. Not just with words, but with heart.<br><br>
        <strong>Kriti Kaushik, will you by valentine? Not just for today, but for all the ordinary days we’ll turn extraordinary together.</strong><br><br>
        With all my love,<br>
        Your forever fanboy 💙
